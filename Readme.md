# Classes in C
In this repo you will find a simple `String` class implementation for C.   
Based on the following article: https://www.pvv.ntnu.no/~hakonhal/main.cgi/c/classes.

A few modifications have been made such as. A heap allocated char buffer which is 
freed on calling `StringClass.destruct`.
